# MAE-DDPM-GravitationalLensing  


---

- **Dataset**  
  - Three types of gravitational-lens images, each showing a different dark-matter layout (courtesy of **ML4Sci / DeepLense**).

- **Task IV — Generative modelling**  
  - Implement a conditional **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)** to synthesise high-fidelity lens images, closing the data gap for rare configurations.  

- **Task VI — Representation learning**  
  - Train a **Masked Autoencoder (MAE)** to extract rich, rotation-invariant features that can be **fine-tuned for downstream classification and single-image super-resolution**.
